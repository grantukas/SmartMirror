## Contributions 
- Researched, iplemented and setup the News API 
  - The News API was implemented using a data science library, Pandas, to easily pull the current news headlines and display 
 them in a readable format. 
  - There were a few hiccups with the News API, to begin with, the module was setup to pull from BBC world news, so that had to be changed 
  - The formatting in Pandas was kind of a headache, because I am used to using pandas primarily in jupyter notebooks. 
  - Once that was all ironed out the News displayed properly and I was very pleased with the output. 
 
- Researched, implemented and setup the google Calandar API 
  - The calandar API was simple to implement, google had a quickstart module that was simple to implement and format.
  - Google requires a sign in upon launching the application and from there it is very straight forward it prints the daily tasks and objectives
