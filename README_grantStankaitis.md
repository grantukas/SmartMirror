### Formatted and organized Python GUI using Tkinter
Tkinter is somewhat of a challenge to use as there isn't much documentation on it. The documentation at [effbot.org](https://effbot.org/tkinterbook/) was very helpfulin setting up and organizing the GUI.
I organized all the text from the APIs into frames to display the information, as well as implemented various other functions, such as using the ESC key to exit the fullscreen GUI. Once it was all set up, everything ran exactly how I envisioned it.
### Implemented Google Assistant and built smart mirror
I set up a Raspberry Pi to run the Google Assistant SDK in the background while running the GUI. It was pretty straightforward as I followed a tutorial online.
To round out the project, I worked with Bobby and Alex to build the smart mirror and attach the LCD screen to the frame, as well as apply mirror film to plexiglass.
